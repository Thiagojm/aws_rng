# True Random Number Generator (TRNG) Data Collector

This Python application is designed for a Raspberry Pi with a TRNG device (TrueRNG, TrueRNGpro, or TrueRNGoroV2) or Bitbbabler. It reads in a number of bits from the TRNG at a user-specified interval and counts the number of 'ones'. The datetime and count are then stored in a .csv file and the bits collected are appended to a .bin file for control.

The project consists of three main scripts:

1. Main Startup Script (start_rng.py): This script is the entry point of the project. At startup, it first checks for an Internet connection and upon establishing a successful connection, it synchronizes the system time to GMT-3 (SÃ£o Paulo). Finally, it launches the two other scripts (rng_collect.py and send_aws.py) in separate terminals.

2. RNG Collect Script (rng_collect.py): This script collects random number generator (RNG) data.

3. Send AWS Script (send_aws.py): This script sends the collected RNG data to an AWS service.

The project also includes a variables.env file, which holds environment variables that are required by the rng_collect.py and send_aws.py scripts.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with Python3 installed (https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html - Refer to this guide if you want to setup a headless Raspberry Pi)
- A TRNG device (TrueRNG) or Bitbbabler
- Internet access
- Python 3.x
- lxterminal package installed (default in most Raspberry Pi distributions)
- The following Python packages: **bitstring**, **python-dotenv**, **pyserial**, **boto3**, **requests**, **ntplib**, **pytz**, **boto3**.

## Setup

### Easy Setup

1. Clone the repository in your Desktop folder:
> 
    git clone https://github.com/Thiagojm/aws_rng.git

2. In the terminal go to yor aws_rng folder and:
> 
    python install.py

3. Choose the option "Full Install"

4. Later if you want to change the parameters just choose "Change Install"

5. Reboot the device.

### Manual Setup

1. Install the required packages if they are not already installed: 
>
    pip install bitstring python-dotenv pyserial requests ntplib pytz

2. In the `vars` folder, rename the `variables.env.default` to `variables.env` and edit to specify the sample size (in bits), the interval between samples, the duration for each data collection cycle, and the paths for the temporary and upload folders. Also give your raspberry a unique ID name, use your AWS keys and bucket name.

3. To install Bitbbabler:
> 
    Double click the bit-babbler_0.8_arm64.deb in the Install folder, to install it.

    In the terminal:
    sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/60-bit-babbler.rules (could be 99-BitBabbler.rules if it doesnt work)

    Copy this inside this file and save: 

    # Voicetronics BitBabbler Black and White
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add|change", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7840", SYMLINK="BitBabbler", MODE="0666"

4. Clone the repository or copy the scripts to your Raspberry Pi.
Give execute permissions to the scripts:

>
    chmod +x /path/to/start_rng.py  
    chmod +x /path/to/rng_collect.py  
    chmod +x /path/to/send_aws.py

5. Create an autostart entry:

> 
    sudo nano /home/pi/.config/autostart/start_rng.desktop

6. Insert the following content into the .desktop file, changing the path to the path of your script, save and exit the file:

>
    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=Application
    Name=StartRng
    Exec=/usr/bin/lxterminal -e "python3 /path/to/start_rng.py.py; bash"

 
7. Make the .desktop file executable:

>
    sudo chmod +x /home/pi/.config/autostart/start_rng.desktop

## Usage

The scripts will run automatically on startup. The main script checks for an internet connection and synchronizes the system time, while the rng_collect.py and send_aws.py scripts will be launched in separate terminal windows.
